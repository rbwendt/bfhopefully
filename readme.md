# bf, hopefully

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rbwendt/bfhopefully.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rbwendt/bfhopefully)

This is my first attempt at writing any kind of interpreter. It's
a brainfuck interpreter written in go. I called it bf hopefully
because bf is less coarse than brainfuck, and because I have a habit 
of not finishing side projects.
